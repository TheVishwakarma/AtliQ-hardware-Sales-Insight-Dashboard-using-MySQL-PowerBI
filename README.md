# *Problem statement of the Project*

AtliQ Hardware, a company specializing in computer hardware and peripherals, operates multiple branches across India. The sales director is encountering challenges in assessing the company's performance and identifying existing issues. Sales have been below expectations and are steadily declining. When the sales director reaches out to regional managers for updates on sales and market conditions, there is a reluctance to engage with detailed numerical data in Excel files, leading to frustration and hindering effective decision-making.
